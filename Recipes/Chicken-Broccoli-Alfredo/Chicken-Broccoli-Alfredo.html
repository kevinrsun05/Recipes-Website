                <h3>Directions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cook the damn pasta as directed on the package and add broccoli to the boiling water for the last 2 minutes of the pasta cooking time. Drain pasta mixture. There's no fucking way you mess this part up. </li>
                    <p></p>
                    <li>Meanwhile (while the pasta is cooking if you can't understand english), heat dressing in large nonstick skillet on medium-high heat (figure out the temperature goof). Add the chicken and cook until it is not pink in the center anymore, stirring occasionally, ~5-7 minutes. REMEMBER THERE IS NO MEDIUM OR RARE FOR CHICKEN. COOK THAT SHIT WELL DONE!</li>
                    <p></p>
                    <li>Stir the pasta in milk, cream cheese, Parmesan cheese, and basil. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Keep going until the sauce is cooked well (figure it out), ~1-2 minutes.</li>
                    <p></p>
                    <li>Add the chicken mixture to the pasta mixture and mix lightly.</li>
                    <li>Eat your pasta now</li>
                    <li>JK you gotta make another 7 portions for because BTS is at your dinner table</li>
                </ol>
